task: weak_priority_labeling
description: |
  Assign a weak priority label to feedback using semantic reasoning
  and optional retrieved context. The label is not final and may be
  overridden by a human.

constraints:
  - Output must be TSV
  - Do NOT modify original feedback text
  - Do NOT hallucinate facts
  - Use retrieved context only if relevant

priority_scale:
  low:
    description: Minor improvement, low urgency, minimal impact
  medium:
    description: Noticeable issue or improvement with moderate impact
  high:
    description: Critical issue, high urgency, or strong impact on outcomes

output_format:
  type: TSV
  columns:
    - feedback_id
    - predicted_priority
    - confidence_score
    - reasoning
    - label_source

labeling_instructions: |
  Use semantic meaning, urgency cues, emotional intensity, and actionability.
  If similar feedback appears frequently in retrieved context, increase priority.
  confidence_score must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
  label_source must always be "weak_llm".

example_input:
  feedback_text: |
    Team meetings often run too long and distract from actual work

  retrieved_context:
    - Several past feedback entries indicate meeting inefficiency reduced productivity
    - High-priority issues previously linked to burnout and missed deadlines

example_output: |
  fb_001<TAB>high<TAB>0.74<TAB>Meeting inefficiency impacts productivity and has recurring negative outcomes<TAB>weak_llm
