task: generate_feedback_dataset_json

description: |
  Generate a synthetic feedback dataset in JSON format.
  The feedback should reflect realistic human behavior, imperfect communication,
  and common failure modes in professional, academic, and personal feedback.

global_constraints:
  - Output must be valid JSON only.
  - Output must be a single JSON array of length N.
  - Use ASCII characters only.
  - No markdown, comments, or explanations.
  - Each object must contain exactly the specified fields.
  - Do not repeat feedback_text or closely paraphrase earlier items.

output_format:
  type: json
  fields:
    - feedback_id
    - feedback_text
    - category
    - source_context
    - actionability_hint

allowed_values:
  category: [growth, team, skill, subject, productivity, communication]
  source_context: [peer_review, manager_feedback, self_reflection, course_feedback]
  actionability_hint: [actionable, partially_actionable, descriptive_only]

generation_instructions: |
  Generate exactly N feedback items.
  feedback_id must be sequential from 0 to N-1.

  Each feedback_text should be grounded in a concrete situation or behavior,
  even if the actionability is unclear.

  Behavioral patterns to distribute across items:
    - unclear expectations
    - misaligned priorities
    - inconsistent performance
    - partial improvement
    - overconfidence or hesitation
    - lack of follow-through
    - unclear ownership
    - passive or indirect communication

  Tone variation:
    - polite but indirect
    - mildly frustrated
    - neutral observational
    - cautiously supportive
    - reflective or self-critical

  Length variation:
    - single short sentence
    - two to three sentences
    - longer feedback with context or reasoning

  Human vs robotic:
    - Some feedback should sound spontaneous and imperfect.
    - Some should sound structured or policy-driven.
    - Some should feel emotionally restrained or overly formal.

  Alignment rules:
    - category must match the dominant theme.
    - actionability_hint must reflect how explicit the suggestion is.
    - source_context should influence tone and expectations.

  Avoid:
    - motivational slogans
    - exaggerated positivity or negativity
    - instructional checklists

hard_failure_rule: |
  If any constraint cannot be satisfied, output [] only.
