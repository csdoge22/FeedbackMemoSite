task: generate_feedback_dataset_json

description: |
  Produce a high-diversity synthetic feedback dataset in JSON format.
  Emphasize lexical variation, stylistic extremes, and non-uniform sentence structure
  while preserving realism.

global_constraints:
  - Output valid JSON only.
  - Single JSON array of exactly N items.
  - ASCII characters only.
  - No additional text outside the JSON array.
  - Each item must include all required fields.
  - No duplicated or near-duplicated feedback_text.

output_format:
  type: json
  fields:
    - feedback_id
    - feedback_text
    - category
    - source_context
    - actionability_hint

allowed_values:
  category: [growth, team, skill, subject, productivity, communication]
  source_context: [peer_review, manager_feedback, self_reflection, course_feedback]
  actionability_hint: [actionable, partially_actionable, descriptive_only]

generation_instructions: |
  Generate exactly N feedback entries.
  Assign feedback_id sequentially from 0 to N-1.

  Lexical diversity requirements:
    - Vary vocabulary and phrasing aggressively.
    - Avoid repeating distinctive words or sentence openings.
    - Mix simple language with more technical or abstract phrasing.

  Stylistic variation:
    - abrupt or minimal feedback
    - verbose, reflective feedback
    - rigid, procedural wording
    - conversational or informal phrasing
    - emotionally flat or emotionally colored

  Sentence structure:
    - mix fragments and full sentences
    - mix direct statements and hedged language
    - vary use of conjunctions and qualifiers

  Human–machine spectrum:
    - Some feedback should read like it came from a system or form.
    - Some should read like casual human remarks.
    - Some should feel intentionally awkward or overly precise.

  Realism constraints:
    - Tone must match source_context expectations.
    - Avoid fictional scenarios or implausible events.
    - Do not include emojis or slang that would be unrealistic in context.

  Semantic focus:
    - Each feedback should clearly emphasize one primary issue.
    - Secondary issues may appear but should not dominate.

hard_failure_rule: |
  If output violates any constraint, return [] only.
