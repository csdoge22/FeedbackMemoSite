task: generate_feedback_dataset

description: |
  Produce a strictly formatted TSV dataset for a feedback prioritizer.

constraints:
  - Output MUST be plain TSV (tab-separated values) with real TAB characters (ASCII 0x09).
  - Newlines (ASCII 0x0A) are allowed only between rows; no blank lines.
  - Do NOT include any text before or after the TSV (no commentary, tags, or explanations).
  - Do NOT include markdown, code fences, or example rows in the output.
  - All characters MUST be ASCII. Do not emit non-ASCII characters.
  - Use only the exact columns and order specified in output_format.columns.
  - The file MUST contain EXACTLY N + 1 lines: 1 header row followed by N data rows.
  - Each data row MUST have exactly five columns separated by real tabs.
  - feedback_id MUST be consecutive integers starting at 0 (0..N-1).

dataset_requirements:
  - relevance: feedback should concern growth, skills, team dynamics, productivity, learning, or performance.
  - diversity: vary tone, length, phrasing, and structure; include implicit and explicit feedback.
  - balance: aim for an even mix of constructive vs critical, emotional vs neutral, actionable vs descriptive.
  - realism: mimic workplace, academic, and team contexts.

output_format:
  type: TSV
  columns:
    - feedback_id
    - feedback_text
    - category
    - source_context
    - actionability_hint

allowed_values:
  category: [growth, team, skill, subject, productivity, communication]
  source_context: [peer_review, manager_feedback, self_reflection, course_feedback]
  actionability_hint: [actionable, partially_actionable, descriptive_only]

generation_instructions: |
  BEGIN TSV OUTPUT ON THE NEXT LINE. DO NOT WRITE ANYTHING BEFORE THE HEADER LINE.

  OUTPUT MUST START IMMEDIATELY WITH THE FOLLOWING HEADER LINE (USE REAL TAB CHARACTERS):
  feedback_id	feedback_text	category	source_context	actionability_hint
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT emit the two-character sequence backslash + t ("\\t"). Use an actual TAB character (press the TAB key) between columns.

  After the header, produce EXACTLY N data rows, one per line, using REAL TAB characters as separators.

  For each data row i (0..N-1) emit columns:
    - feedback_id: integer i
    - feedback_text: exactly ONE sentence, ASCII only, containing no TABs or newlines
    - category: one of the values in allowed_values.category
    - source_context: one of the values in allowed_values.source_context
    - actionability_hint: one of the values in allowed_values.actionability_hint

  Formatting rules:
    - Use REAL tabs only as column separators.
    - No extra whitespace at line ends or between fields beyond single tabs.
    - Do NOT include enumeration, bullets, or quote marks around fields.

  Uniqueness and diversity (important):
    - DO NOT repeat the exact same `feedback_text` more than once in the entire output.
    - Vary phrasing, sentence structure, and vocabulary to maximize diversity across rows.
    - Avoid producing formulaic or template-like sentences; small surface changes are not sufficient.
    - Do NOT output identical rows across batches; each data row must be unique.

  HARD FAILURE RULE:
  If you cannot meet ALL constraints exactly, output exactly this single line and nothing else:
  REFUSE: unable to generate a valid dataset under the given constraints.

example_note: |
  (Do NOT include this example in output.) The header must match exactly the header line above.
